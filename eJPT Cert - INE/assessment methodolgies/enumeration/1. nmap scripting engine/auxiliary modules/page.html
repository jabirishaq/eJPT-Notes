<title>Auxiliary Modules</title>
</head><body>is used to scan and host scanning or fuzzing etc.<br/>
<br/>
just like a es public portal and from there we can reach to other servers, here auxiliary methods are used<br/>
<br/>
cannot be compared with the payloads<br/>
<br/>
they are uesed to extract information.<br/>
<br/>
why?<br/>
<br/>
in terms of discovery, they are used for post exploitation<br/>
<br/>
target a network of a server and we need to exploit and is a part of network, and we know we have more targets as the gold mine in order to reach out to the rest of the compters <br/>
<br/>
we cannot access externally so the way is through this exploited sustem<br/>
<br/>
we need these methods to dig deep nad find the ways to exploit these<br/>
<br/>
exposed is Target1 and we will reach to Target2 by executing the auxiliary methods from Target1.<br/>
<br/>
add a network on Target1 that will allow us to execute auxiliary methods to scan the ports and we check the open ports.<br/>
<br/>
in msf console, add a workspace called Port_Scan<br/>
<br/>
for auxiliary methods scan use:<br/>
<br/>
search portscan<br/>
<br/>
now use the method with tcp<br/>
<br/>
show options will reveal the options added to it<br/>
<br/>
like one of it is PORTS 1-10000 <br/>
