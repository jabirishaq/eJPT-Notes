<title>FTP Enumeration</title>
</head><body>FTP is file transfer protocol<br/>
<br/>
it is also frequesntly used as a means of transferring files to and from directory of a web server.<br/>
<br/>
we can use multiple auxiliary modules to enumerate information as well as perform brute-force attacks on targets running an FTP server<br/>
<br/>
FTP authentiation utilizes a username and password combination however in some cases improperly configured FTP server can be logged into anonymously<br/>
<br/>
Brute force can be applied for breaking the username passwords.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lab working:<br/>
<br/>
service postgresql start<br/>
<br/>
msfconsole<br/>
<br/>
serch the auxiliary modules for ftp<br/>
<br/>
search type name:ftp<br/>
<br/>
use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_version<br/>
<br/>
set RHOSTS<br/>
<br/>
show options make sure the RHOSTS are there<br/>
<br/>
hit run <br/>
<br/>
Banner is exposed<br/>
<br/>
now search the proFTPD<br/>
<br/>
go back<br/>
<br/>
use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_login<br/>
<br/>
show options<br/>
<br/>
this has options to add the User_File and Pass_File from the default paths<br/>
<br/>
set both the files and the RHOSTS<br/>
<br/>
run it will brute force the files and it will show in green the files that are found<br/>
<br/>
now make sure it is logged in<br/>
<br/>
ftp &lt;target ip address&gt;<br/>
<br/>
if it is not overwhelmed it will be logged in from the passwords that were brute forced<br/>
<br/>
